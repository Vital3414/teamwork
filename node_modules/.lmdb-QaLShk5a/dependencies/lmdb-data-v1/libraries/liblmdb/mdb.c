/* We use native NT APIs to setup the memory map, so that we can
 * let the DB file grow incrementally instead of always preallocating
 * the full size. These APIs are defined in <wdm.h> and <ntifs.h>
 * but those headers are meant for driver-level development and
 * conflict with the regular user-level headers, so we explicitly
 * declare them here. We get pointers to these functions from
 * NTDLL.DLL at runtime, to avoid buildtime dependencies on any
 * NTDLL import libraries.
